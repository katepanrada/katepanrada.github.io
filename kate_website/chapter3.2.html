    <p class="intro-3">What is Chapter 3.2 all about. Let's find out here!</p>

    <p class="info-p"> We refer to a collection of data stored in a computer system as a ‘file’. Files are often organised into ‘folders’. <br> <br>
     Whenever you click ‘Save’ in an application, burn files to a CD-R, copy music onto your MP3 player, or drag and drop a file onto memory stick, you are using storage devices - devices that can store and retrieve data.</p>

     <h2 class="topic"><b><b>Serial / Sequential Access</b></b></h2>

     <img src="Images\table.png" alt="a table" id="table1-img">

     <p class="info-p"> A serial (or sequential) access storage device is one that stores files one-by-one in a sequence. <br><br>
    A non-computer serial access device that will be familiar to you is a VHS videotape. Because video is stored on a long piece of tape, when TV shows are recorded onto the tape, they go on one-by-one, in order...</p>

    <p class="info-p">If you want to watch a show that you recorded earlier, you have to rewind / fast-forward through all other shows until you find it.<br> <br>
    The shows are only accessible in the same order that you recorded them. This type of one-by-one storage and access is called serial access.</p>

    <h3 class="topic"><b><b>Direct / Random Access</b></b></h2>

    <img src="Images\stacks_image_2031.png" alt="a table" id="stacks-img">

    <p class="info-p"> A direct (or ‘random’) access storage device is one that stores files so that they can be instantly accessed - there is no need to search through other files to get to the one you want.
        <br><br>
        An example of a direct access device would be a DVD movie. Unlike the VHS videotape movie, you can jump to any scene on a DVD.
        <br><br>
        All parts of the DVD are directly accessible. This type of file storage is called direct access.</p>
